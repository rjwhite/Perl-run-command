0.0.1       Aug 15, 2016
    - initial version

0.0.2       Aug 26, 2016
    - run_command_wait() now leverages off of run_command()
      so that stderr can be controlled as well.
    - lots of refactoring
    - perldoc
    - test programs moved to test-progs/

0.0.2.1     Sep 3, 2016
    - don't throw away newlines when ignoring stderr.
      was causing inconsistent behavior between newline handling with
      different actions of stderr
    - created a test-progs/errors.plx program to now be called by
      test-progs/test-run_command.plx

0.0.2.2     Oct 27, 2016
    - a sub-shell added (within the sub-shell) when stderr and stdout
      are separated.  This is in case the user provides multiple
      commands on the same line such as "echo blah ; date"

0.0.3       Mar 21, 2022
    - removed OWNER and GROUP to rely only on the parent Makefile.inc
      (which had changed those entries)
    - added dprint to @EXPORT_OK
